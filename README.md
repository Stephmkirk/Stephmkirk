# Hi there! 🦊 #

## About me ##

I graduated from the University of British Columbia with a BA in Psychology in 2019, and received my MA in Museum Studies & Curatorial Practice from Nanyang Technological University in 2021. Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the [Clinical Brain Lab](http://www.clinicalbrain.org/).
I'm keen on understanding how creative place-making and neuroaesthetics can be used to promote community resilience, especially for marginalized communities 👩‍🎨 🧠 🏡

When procrastinating, I can be found baking (and eating) bread 🥖 and reading SF/F 🧝‍♀️ 

😄 Pronouns: she/her
